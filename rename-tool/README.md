# Gradescope Rename Tool

### What makes this different from the [file tool](../file-tool/)?
The original file tool uses a template to merge student submissions with starter code. Use this tool instead if you want to rename student submissions without using a template.

### Usage
Run the .jar file and select the directory you exported from Gradescope. The tool will do the rest.
